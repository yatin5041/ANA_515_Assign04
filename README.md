This is a project to implement customer segmentation in R. This is a study based on the Mall Customer dataset with variables Customer ID, Gender, Age, Annual Income in thousand $, and spending score in the range of 1 to 100. There are 200 rows in the dataset. 

K-means algorithm is used to determine k number of centroids. The optimum cluster is determined using Elbow method and Silhouette method. The further analysis is done using k=6 which is derived using Silhouette method. 

With this method, we could identify customers with high income-high spending, high income-low spending, low income-low spending, medium income-medium spending, low income-high spending.

Using Principal Component Analysis, we could identify segments of target customers for the mall.
